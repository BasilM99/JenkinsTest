				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on January 6, 2013.</p>
				<p>Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of AdFalcon (“AdFalcon”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Noqoush Mobile Media Group FZ LLC and has been created to provide information about our mobile advertising platform and services for advertisers, agencies and publishers (together with the Site and related services, the “AdFalcon Services”) to our Site visitors and others who use and interact with the AdFalcon Services (“you”, “your”).</p>
				<p>This Privacy Policy sets forth AdFalcon’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors and in connection with the AdFalcon Services.</p>
				<p>This Privacy Policy also describes AdFalcon’s practices with respect to information we collect from visitors to the websites and services of our partners who use the AdFalcon Services.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>AdFalcon Third Party Ad Serving</h2>
				<h3> Specific Information for Visitors to Sites and Applications that Use the AdFalcon Services:</h3>
				<p>• AdFalcon may access, index, and cache requests made from publishers’ mobile websites and applications (“Publisher Sites”) to our system. When providing AdFalcon Services, AdFalcon collects data from Publisher Sites (as described in more detail below) and uses such data for a number of purposes, including providing publishers, advertisers and others with aggregate information about traffic and site usage. To collect information, AdFalcon drops cookies or uses other technologies to optimize advertisements served and to personalize advertising content for visitors to Publisher Sites. We also use such information to prevent users from seeing the same advertisement repeatedly, to monitor and identify fraudulent clicks, and to collect data regarding the success and click-through rate of advertisements.</p>
				<p>• AdFalcon collects or receives information about visitors to Publisher Sites such as session and click information, device information, unique device identifiers and geo-location. AdFalcon may also derive location information from wireless carriers, certain third-party service providers, or directly from mobile devices. From the Publisher Site providers, AdFalcon may receive and use non-personally identifiable information (such as demographic data or interests) about Publisher Site visitors to provide information to advertisers and others and to help us display advertisements that may be of interest to Publisher Site visitors.</p>
				<p>• Third party advertisers, publishers and ad networks do not have access to Publisher Site visitors’ Personal Data, except that, if a visitor chooses to share it (for example, by entering an email address in order to receive an offer or promotional code, or providing a telephone number to receive a text message alert), then AdFalcon shares this Personal Data with the applicable advertiser only to fulfill the Publisher Site visitor’s request, and we delete this information when it is no longer needed. </p>
				<hr>
				<h3>Other Information About AdFalcon’s Privacy Practices in General</h3>
				<p> Information We Collect: When you interact with us through the AdFalcon Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
				<h3>• Personal Data That You Provide Through the AdFalcon Services</h3>
				<p>We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to surveys, sign up to receive information or updates from our partners, register for access to the AdFalcon Services or use certain AdFalcon Services. Personal Data we collect may include for example, your name; home and/or business address; e-mail address; home and/or business telephone, wireless and/or fax number; and credit card and other payment information. </p>
				<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data through the AdFalcon Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of AdFalcon and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States or elsewhere.</p>
				<h3>• Non-Identifiable Data</h3>
				<p>When you interact with AdFalcon or our partners through the AdFalcon Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. AdFalcon may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by AdFalcon affiliates, agents or service providers. The AdFalcon Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.</p>
				<p>In operating the AdFalcon Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts the AdFalcon Services gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, the AdFalcon Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the AdFalcon Services’ features.</p>
				<h3>• Aggregated Personal Data</h3>
				<p>In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the AdFalcon Services, AdFalcon often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and AdFalcon may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. AdFalcon may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
				<h3>• Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
				<p>AdFalcon uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the AdFalcon Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
					<p>AdFalcon and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the AdFalcon Services to help us improve and customize the content and functionality of the AdFalcon Services, to better understand our users and to improve the AdFalcon Services. AdFalcon and its Related Companies may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact at <a href="mailto:info@AdFalcon.com">info@adfalcon.com</a>. </p>
					<p>If AdFalcon intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>
				</p>
				<h3>• Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>AdFalcon is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</li>
					<li>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</li>
					<li>Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
					<li>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: AdFalcon, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</li>
					<li>Legal Requirements: AdFalcon may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Company, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. </li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<h3>• Exclusions</h3>
				<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by AdFalcon other than Personal Data collected through the AdFalcon Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to AdFalcon through the AdFalcon Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the AdFalcon Services, such as bulletin boards (collectively, “Public Areas”), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and AdFalcon shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.</p>
				<h3>• Children</h3>
				<p>AdFalcon does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the AdFalcon Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the AdFalcon Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to AdFalcon through the AdFalcon Services through this Site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
				<h3>• Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
				<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the AdFalcon Services. The AdFalcon Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by AdFalcon (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the AdFalcon Services do not imply that AdFalcon endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>
				<h3>• Security</h3>
				<p>AdFalcon takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the AdFalcon Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the AdFalcon Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to AdFalcon via the Internet.</p>
				<h3>• Changes to AdFalcon's Privacy Policy</h3>
				<p>The AdFalcon Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for AdFalcon to make changes to this Privacy Policy.

Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the AdFalcon Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.</p>
