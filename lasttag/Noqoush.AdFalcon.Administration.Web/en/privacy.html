                            <p>Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of AdFalcon (“AdFalcon”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Noqoush Mobile Media Group FZ LLC and has been created to provide information about our mobile advertising platform and services for advertisers, agencies and publishers (together with the Site and related services, the “AdFalcon Services”) to our Site visitors and others who use and interact with the AdFalcon Services (“you”, “your”).</p>
                            <p>This Privacy Policy sets forth AdFalcon’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors and in connection with the AdFalcon Services.</p>
                            <p>This Privacy Policy also describes AdFalcon’s practices with respect to information we collect from visitors to the websites and services of our partners who use the AdFalcon Services.</p>

							<h3>AdFalcon Third Party Ad Serving</h3>
						<p><strong>Specific Information for Visitors to Sites and Applications that Use the AdFalcon Services:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="circle-list">
							<li>AdFalcon may access, index, and cache requests made from publishers’ mobile websites and applications (“Publisher Sites”) to our system. When providing AdFalcon Services, AdFalcon collects data from Publisher Sites (as described in more detail below) and uses such data for a number of purposes, including providing publishers, advertisers and others with aggregate information about traffic and site usage. To collect information, AdFalcon drops cookies or uses other technologies to optimize advertisements served and to personalize advertising content for visitors to Publisher Sites. We also use such information to prevent users from seeing the same advertisement repeatedly, to monitor and identify fraudulent clicks, and to collect data regarding the success and click-through rate of advertisements.</li>
                            <li>AdFalcon collects or receives information about visitors to Publisher Sites such as session and click information, device information, unique device identifiers and geo-location. AdFalcon may also derive location information from wireless carriers, certain third-party service providers, or directly from mobile devices. From the Publisher Site providers, AdFalcon may receive and use non-personally identifiable information (such as demographic data or interests) about Publisher Site visitors to provide information to advertisers and others and to help us display advertisements that may be of interest to Publisher Site visitors.</li>
                            <li>Third party advertisers, publishers and ad networks do not have access to Publisher Site visitors’ Personal Data, except that, if a visitor chooses to share it (for example, by entering an email address in order to receive an offer or promotional code, or providing a telephone number to receive a text message alert), then AdFalcon shares this Personal Data with the applicable advertiser only to fulfill the Publisher Site visitor’s request, and we delete this information when it is no longer needed.</li>
